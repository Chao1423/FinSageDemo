## Welcome to FinSage

Website: http://1.14.196.161
Domain Name: www.wanchaoz.site (now only available on Safari)

Please follow the instructions below to begin the App trails.

1. This version is only for internal tests. **!!! Don't share the website with others !!!**  Every time the app runs, it consumes API quota. **Copyright@Wanchao ZHAO - Email: wanchzhao3-c@my.cityu.edu.hk**

2. Please be patient when using the app since the server is located in the mainland and has limited bandwidth.

3. Once the app is loaded, you may utilize FinSage by typing questions and clicking the **"send"** button. FinSage has the particular ability to get stock data and give buy-sell recommendations at one-day intervals using technical indicators. Meanwhile, it remains the capability to answer any other questions (i.e. restaurant recommendations)

4. **Function 1:** If you chose to search stock data (i.e. close price/EMA 10 days), please specify the date you want. **Function 2:** If you want a recommendation, you may ask, "Give me a buy-sell recommendation of Apple's stock using technical analysis." The loading time could be much longer for function calling (around 2 minutes) than asking other questions without functions.

5. The project is incomplete so far. Function 1 may return the results of the data not found, which may be due to the limited API quota of the financial data website. More functions will also be added to achieve machine learning/time series analysis of the stocks.

6. Each input and output will be recorded on a thread, and chat histories will be appended after each conversation. If you want to clear the chat history, click the **"reset"** button. Note that recovery will no longer be possible once the app is reset.

7. The website will be closed after the testing period.
